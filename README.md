# capocaccia-spinnaker-workgroup

## Installation
**Don't git clone the classical way!** Instead run:  
```
git clone git@github.com:GabrielBena/capocaccia-spinnaker-workgroup.git --recursive
```  
This is required in order to clone all the nested repos.

Then create your own environment. This could be done using conda or just running:    
```
python -m env env
```
and then activate the environment:  
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
With conda, an environement called cc_spinn will be created when running the script.

Run the installer running:
```
bash pip_install.sh
```
Or for a conda install  
```
bash conda_install.sh  
```
